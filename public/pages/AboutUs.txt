# Unity Sports
//## Our Mission
// Unity Sports and Cultural Association is a non-profit organization
 that has been serving the New England community since 1971. The club was
  founded by a group of Caribbean immigrants who wanted to share their culture,
   sports, and social justice values with others. They also wanted to create a space
    where they could connect with their roots, preserve their identity, and foster a sense of belonging in their new home.

//Today, the club has grown to become one of the most active and inclusive Caribbean-American clubs in the region, hosting various events and activities throughout the year. The clubâ€™s mission is to promote unity, diversity, and social justice in New England through sports and cultural events that celebrate the rich heritage and traditions of the Caribbean.

//The club offers a range of sports programs for its members and guests, such as cricket, soccer, basketball, volleyball, tennis, and more. The club also organizes cultural events that showcase the vibrant and colorful aspects of Caribbean culture, such as music, dance, art, food, and more. Some of our signature events include the Caribbean-American Cultural Expo, the Senior Citizens Thanksgiving Luncheon, the Unity Day Parade, and the Unity Awards Gala.

//The club also supports various causes and charities that benefit the local and global community. The club has donated to relief efforts for natural disasters in the Caribbean, sponsored scholarships for students of Caribbean descent, partnered with local organizations to provide health and wellness services, and advocated for social justice issues that affect the Caribbean-American community.

//The club welcomes members and guests of all backgrounds and interests to join its vibrant and diverse community and enjoy its facilities and amenities. The club has a spacious clubhouse that features a banquet hall, a bar, a lounge, a library, a game room, and a gym. The club also has a large outdoor field that can accommodate various sports activities.
