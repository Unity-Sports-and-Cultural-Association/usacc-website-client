# Annual Events
//## Senior Citizens Thanksgiving
//Unity Sports and Cultural Club is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1968 by a
 group of cricket enthusiasts. Since then, we have grown to become one of the largest Caribbean-American
  based non-profits in New England, with a mission to promote sports, culture, and community service.

One of our signature events is the annual Senior Citizens Thanksgiving Luncheon, which we have been hosting
 since 1979 at our home at 10 Dunbar Avenue in Dorchester, Massachusetts1. Every year, we invite senior citizens
  from all over Boston to join us for a festive and free meal, where they can enjoy delicious food, live music, and
   friendly company.

//We organize this event because we believe that senior citizens are an important and valuable part of our community,
 and we want to show them our gratitude and respect. We also want to share our Caribbean heritage and culture with them,
  and celebrate the diversity and unity of Boston.

Our event is made possible by the generous donations and volunteer efforts of our
 members, supporters, and partners. We thank the Boston Police Department’s Area B-3
  for their invaluable help in prior years and look forward to their assistance, and to the bands that participate in our events.

We hope that you will join us for this special occasion, and help us make this year’s Senior
 Citizens Thanksgiving Luncheon a memorable and joyful one. Please contact us for more
  information or to RSVP. We look forward to seeing you soon!

//## Caribbean-American & Cultural Expo
//The Caribbean-American Cultural Expo is a celebration of the vibrant and colorful
 heritage of the Caribbean islands and their people. It is one of the oldest and largest
  multicultural festivals in Broward County, Florida1, and it is held every year on a Sunday
   in October at the Unity Sports and Cultural Club in Dorchester, Massachusetts2.

The expo showcases the rich and diverse culture of the Caribbean through music, dance,
 art, food, and more. You can enjoy live performances from local and internationally
  acclaimed artists representing countries throughout the Caribbean, such as Pumpa,
   Mr. Vegas, Roger George, Rae, Hal Anthony, Honorebel, Trini Jacobs, Marcia Ball,
    Julien Believe, Brianna Bruton, Youni-T, and more1. You can also explore displays
     of Caribbean cultural artifacts, such as paintings, sculptures, costumes, and instruments.

//The expo is also a great opportunity to support the Caribbean-American community and learn about
 their history and contributions to our nation. The expo is held during the National Caribbean-American
  Heritage Month, which recognizes the countless gifts and achievements of Caribbean Americans in various
   fields, such as politics, education, justice, arts, and sports. The expo also promotes the values of diversity and unity that are essential to our American identity.

//The expo is made possible by the hard work and dedication of our volunteers, 
who help with setting up, managing booths, performing, and promoting the event.
 We are always looking for more volunteers who share our passion for Caribbean 
 culture and community service. If you are interested in volunteering for this year’s 
 expo, please contact us for more information. We would love to have you on board!

//We hope that you will join us for this year’s Caribbean-American Cultural Expo,
 and help us make it a fun and memorable experience for everyone. Please visit our
  website for more details about the event, including the date, time, location, tickets, lineup, vendors, sponsors, and more.
