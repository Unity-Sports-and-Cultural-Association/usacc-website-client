# Annual Events
//## Senior Citizens Thanksgiving
//

One of our signature events is the annual Senior Citizens Thanksgiving Luncheon, which we have been hosting
 since 1979. Every year, we invite senior citizens
  from all over Boston to join us for a festive and free meal, where they can enjoy delicious food, live music, and
   friendly company.

//We organize this event because we believe that senior citizens are an important and valuable part of our community,
 and we want to show them our gratitude and respect. We also want to share our Caribbean heritage and culture with them,
  and celebrate the diversity and unity of Boston.

Our event is made possible by the generous donations and volunteer efforts of our
 members, supporters, and partners. We thank the Boston Police Department’s Area B-3
  for their invaluable help in prior years and look forward to their assistance, and to the bands that participate in our events.

We hope that you will join us for this special occasion, and help us make this year’s Senior
 Citizens Thanksgiving Luncheon a memorable and joyful one. Please contact us for more
  information.

//## Caribbean-American & Cultural Expo
//The Caribbean-American Cultural Expo is a celebration of the vibrant and colorful
 heritage of the Caribbean islands and their people, and it is held every year
   in October at Unity.

The expo showcases the rich and diverse culture of the Caribbean through music, dance,
 art, food, and more. You can enjoy live performances from local and internationally
  acclaimed artists representing countries throughout the Caribbean. You can also explore displays
     of Caribbean cultural artifacts, such as paintings, sculptures, costumes, and instruments.

//The expo is made possible by the hard work and dedication of our volunteers, 
who help with setting up, managing booths, performing, and promoting the event.
 We are always looking for more volunteers who share our passion for Caribbean 
 culture and community service. If you are interested in volunteering for this year’s 
 expo, please contact us for more information.
